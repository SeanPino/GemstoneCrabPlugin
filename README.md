# Gemstone Crab Plugin
This plugin counts your eligible Gemstone Crab kills, mining attempts, successes, and failures. You are notified if you got the kills or you didn't participate enough for it to count.
> Note: To be eligible for kills you are required to interact with the crab and be around for at least 5mins since it spawned (so ~50% health).


## Overlay
The plugin comes with a built-in overlay to show your quick stats for kill count by default. It will only show when nearby one of the crab areas.

In settings you can additionally have it show your mining attempts, successes, and failures.

Example below:
